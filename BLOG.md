I created this project because from time to time I want my Shell scripts to
spit out nice colorful logs to `stderr` with neither relying on any external
fully fledged logging framework or a few functions copied into the scripts
themselves. That said, `log.sh` is not meant to replace real logging. But
`log.sh` can be helpful for example in making CI job logs more readable.
